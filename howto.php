			<h4>With your PCT international patent application coming to its 30 month deadline, it is time to consider filing national phase patents.</h4>
			
			<p><strong>Why file in Africa?</strong></p>
                        <p>African States now boast some of the fastest growing economies in the world. For instance, in 2013, the GDP of Nigeria increased by 89%. South Africa remains the largest economy in Africa and is a member of the BRICS. You can get comprehensive protection throughout most of Africa by filing only four patents - South African, Nigerian, OAPI (covering Northern African States) and ARIPO (covering Southern African States) patents. 
			<p><strong>How do we offer such competitive pricing?</strong></p>
                        <p>We are associated with a reputable South African patent law firm that has over the past eight years established relationships with reliable and affordable agents throughout Africa.
			<p><strong>How do we prosecute patents to grant?</strong></p>
			<p>We differ from many other patent registration firms offering services over the Internet in that we do not merely pass you on to a third party agent. We "stay in the loop", ensuring an efficient and consistent prosecution of all your African patents to grant.<p/>
			<p><strong>Which countries are covered by the OAPI regional patent?</strong></p>
                        <p>Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoro Island, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo.</p>
		        <p><strong>Which countries are covered by the ARIPO regional patent?</strong></p>
                        <p>Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
